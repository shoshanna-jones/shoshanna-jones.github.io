    <h1>Gathering History with the 2021 Census</h1>
    <h3>by Shanna Jones - 8 November 2020</h3>
    <p>The next census of England and Wales, taken once a decade, is due to take place on Sunday, 21st March 2021. The survey, which will be sent to all residents of the two nations, will gather the most complete source of information we have about the population since the last census in 2011.</p>
    <p>Carrying out the census, no small task, is currently being planned and organised by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS is in charge of censuses in England and Wales only, the Scottish census is organised by the National Records of Scotland (NRS) and the Northern Irish census is run by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA).</p>
    <p>The ONS will conduct the census in line with international best practice methods and the Code of Practice for Statistics under the scrutiny of the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR). These methods are intended to ensure that the census is of public value, high quality and produced by trustworthy people and organisations. </p>
    <p>Anonymised data collected from the census of England and Wales will be publicly searchable in order to get information about demographics on a local and country level. After the Census is completed all personal details will be kept anonymous for the next 100 years.</p>    
    <h2>Looking Back at the Census, 6000 years on.</h2>
    <p>The concept of the census is old as the ancient civilizations of Greece, Rome, Egypt and China. The very first Census known of in human memory was carved onto clay tiles in the ancient city of Babylon around 3800 BC in order to ascertain how much food needed to be gathered to feed each member of the population.</p>
    <p>Many years later, ancient Egyptians, Chinese and Roman societies used Census-taking to count their populations. These civilisations used their data to decide on the scale of labour force they would need to build the pyramids, find out how many households were in their nation and determine taxes.</p>
    <p>In England Census-taking can be traced back a thousand years to the Domesday book in 1086 and the Hundred Rolls of 1279, the first to establish the ownership of assets; the latter an inquiry into landholding. Although these two surveys weren’t Censuses in the way we know of them today they act as such to provide historians and genealogists with rich resources to envisage the populations of times gone by. </p>
    <p>Census surveys as we know them began in the 1800s driven by a concern that a growing population would soon outstrip food and resources. Recorded with pen and paper, the early censuses needed a huge number of clerks to ensure the accurate record-taking of the entire population. Census-taking was made easier in 1911 with the introduction of punch cards and counting machines and again in 1961 with the introduction of computers. </p>
    
    <h2>Society and the Census Today</h2>
    <p>For the first time in 2021, the Census in England and Wales will be taken predominantly online. There will be a 75% online return rate target with thought given to those people who may find other methods of completing their survey more accessible, such as by phone or post.</p>
    <p>In recent decades Censuses have allowed analysts to drill down into socio-economic factors in society leading to deeper understanding of inequalities and modern-day life. From health to age to gender pay gaps, the richness of modern-day Census data provides meaningful insights. </p>
    <p>The period between 2001 to 2011 saw the first fall in levels of <a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160107120404/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/a-century-of-home-ownership-and-renting-in-england-and-wales/sty-home-ownership.html">home ownership</a> in a century with London having the highest percentage of renters at 50.4%. The Census also gave us a good idea of the demographics of people living in particular areas. <a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105213527/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/coastal-communities/rpt-coastal-communities.html">20% of the population</a> of coastal communities were over the age of 65 and 7% of adults under the age of 65 had long-term health problems such as an illness or disability.</p>
    <h2>What we learned in 2011</h2>
    <p>The 2011 Census led to analysis of England and Wales, which drilled down into socio-economic factors in society leading to a deeper understanding of inequalities and modern-day life. From health to age to gender pay gaps, the richness of census data can provide useful insights. </p>
    <p>The period between 2001 to 2011 saw the first fall in levels of <a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160107120404/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/a-century-of-home-ownership-and-renting-in-england-and-wales/sty-home-ownership.html">home ownership</a> in a century with London having the highest percentage of renters at 50.4%. The Census also gave us a good idea of the demographics of people living in particular areas. <a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105213527/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/coastal-communities/rpt-coastal-communities.html">20% of the population of coastal communities</a> were over the age of 65 and 7% of adults under the age of 65 had long-term health problems such as an illness or disability.</p>
    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h2>What changed for families and households since 2001?</h2>
    <p>In the 10 years between the last two Censuses, subtle changes have taken place in the household compositions of society. The category which decreased the most over the decade were one family households with a married couple or same sex couple in a civil partnership with dependent children. In 2001 this group made up 17.6% of households while in 2011 they made up 15.2%. </p>
    <p>The law on same sex civil partnerships came into place in 2004 meaning that the 2001 data did not contain any same sex civil partnerships in the household composition data. This indicates that the proportion of opposite sex married couples with dependent children has fallen at a greater level than is available within the data set.</p>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h2>The Struggle for Representation</h2>
    <p>Although questions and details on the Census survey may seem arbitrary at first thought, the data gathered from these answers helps to inform public spending decision makers, charity providers, businesses and much more. The data taken from the Census can have an affect on quality of life and access to services. </p>
    <p>Representation in the Census appears to be a contentious topic with several groups of people. Humanists lobby for non-religious terminology to be included as a ‘lack of provision of non-religious pastoral care in hospitals, prisons, education and the armed services” according to the <a href="https://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/features/humanist-paul-kaufman-on-census-questions-1-6851028">Newham Recorder</a>. Some people would like a distinct <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-50643415">Welsh Ethnic Minority</a> group box to tick on Census forms, groups in Cornwall want <a href="https://www.falmouthpacket.co.uk/news/18407598.no-cornish-tick-box-2021-census-despite-national-minority/">the county to be recognised as a nation</a> and the Royal British Legion <a href="https://www.britishlegion.org.uk/get-involved/things-to-do/campaigns-policy-and-research/campaigns/count-them-in#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20estimated%20that,of%20the%20UK%27s%20general%20population.&text=The%20decision%20to%20include%20a,into%20this%20relatively%20hidden%20community.">campaigned</a> to have a ‘served in the armed forces’ box included in the Census.</p>
    <p>According to <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/12/latin-americans-are-one-uks-fastest-growing-groups-so-why-arent-they-recognised">an article</a> published in The New Statesman, Latin American people are the fastest growing ethnic group in England and Wales. However, they are not recognised as an official ethnicity on the Census. Previously people from Latin America would have to tick the ‘other ethnicity’ box on their Census forms. This <a href="https://vimeo.com/357942794">short documentary</a> by Brazilian filmmaker Romano Pizzichini tells the story of how many Latin Americans feel “invisible”.</p>
    <p>Campaign group LatinXcluded who have called for representation for the estimated 250,000 Latin American people living in England and Wales met with the ONS earlier this year in the hope that their ethnic group would be included on the 2021 Census. </p>
    <p>For the needs of ethnic minorities to be included in public service and charity decision making the data needs to be available. From the 2011 Census, this sunburst chart shows the ethnic groups that make up the populations of urban and rural location types across England and Wales.</p>
    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/4416439"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    <p>As the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world, data has helped explain why the virus has affected some groups of people more than others. People of ethnic minorities have been disproportionately infected with the virus. One of the reasons for this has been that people of ethnic minority backgrounds are far more likely to live in built up areas where the risk of COVID-19 is greater, than those of White ethnic backgrounds. At present, the 2011 Census is the richest source of information available on where ethnic minorites tend to live and has been useful in building up a picture of why the virus has impacted ethnic minority groups to such an extent. In 2011 rural areas were 97.5% White while Urban areas were 83.3% White. In very built up areas (urban conurbations) they were on average 63.8% White.</p>

    <h2>The Future of the Census</h2>
    <p>Although the Census has been a valued part of society for over 200 years, the practicalities of its future are being considered. This year the Census is due to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/11/household-census-may-be-scrapped-in-favour-of-cheaper-system">cost £1bn</a> of public money. However, given that the Census provides us with such a rich insight into the population, a very impressive suitable alternative would need to be provided in place of it. Vital public services, useful businesses, policy planning and fund-giving all rely on the data in order to make informed decisions. National Statistician, Ian Diamond, discussed with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/11/household-census-may-be-scrapped-in-favour-of-cheaper-system">The Guardian</a> about possible alternatives: “I will only make a recommendation to change the way we do things if we can replicate the richness of the census data,” he said.</p>
    <h2>A Growing Population</h2>
    <p>Each decade from 1981 to 2011 Census data tells us the population of England and Wales. Seeing as 2011 was almost 10 years ago, the most recent data are the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/annualmidyearpopulationestimates/latest">mid-2019 population estimates</a>, which puts the population of England and Wales at nearly 67 million. If the growth in population continues at a similar rate it’s possible that England and Wales could surpass a billion residents in 60 years' time.</p>
