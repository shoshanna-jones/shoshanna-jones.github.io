<h1>Care Home COVID-19 Deaths Continue Rising</h1>
<h3>by Shanna Jones - 24 November 2020</h3>

<p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) death registrations in care homes have increased each week since the beginning of September 2020. </p>
<p>In the latest week beginning 13 November 2020 393 COVID-19 deaths were registered compared with 17 in the first week of September according to data from the most recent <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/weekly-deaths-local-authority/editions/time-series/versions?%3Auri=weekly-deaths-local-authority%2Feditions%2Ftime-series%2Fversions%2F">Death registrations and occurrences by local authority and place of death time-series</a> dataset released on 24 November 2020. </p>
<p>The dataset shows that COVID-19 death registrations in care homes rose by 14% in the last week (beginning 12 November 2020) to 393 death registrations up from 344 last week. October saw a steady rise of COVID-19 death occurrences and registrations leading to the numbers seen in November.</p>
<p>In September the weekly average for death registrations in care homes across England and Wales was 28 but during October it rose to 107 and during the two weeks we currently have on record in November the weekly average rose to 369. During October 2020, data from the data show that COVID-19 death registrations in care homes more than tripled (a 231% increase) since September. In the most recent week we have the data for, the week beginning 13 November there were 425 care home COVID-19 death registrations compared to 17 in the first week of September. </p>
<p>A death registration refers to the official record kept by a registrar normally based on a doctor’s Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD). This certificate is normally taken to the registrar by someone close to the deceased within five days of the date of death. A death occurrence refers to the day the person died. Under certain circumstances deaths are referred to a corona who sends information to a registrar, which may take longer.</p>
<p>High Peak Local Authority in Derbyshire had the highest number of deaths in care homes during October at 10 deaths occurrences and registrations. In the same period, Sefton, Tameside and the East Riding of Yorkshire saw 10 death registrations in care homes while Cardiff saw 10 care home death occurrences. Across England and Wales in October, 600 COVID-19 care home deaths occurrences were recorded while 535 COVID-19 care home death registrations were recorded.</p>
<p>During the two weeks we have data for in November, Doncaster, Bradford and County Durham saw the highest number of coronavirus (COVID-19) death registrations in care homes at 32, 34 and 21 respectively.</p>

<p><b>Caption: 275 local authorities recorded COVID-19 deaths in care homes during October while 293 local authorities recorded similar death occurrences. In September only 52 local authorities registered COVID-19 deaths in care homes.</b></p>
<p>Nearly 9 out of 10 (87%) of Local Authorities in England and Wales recorded coronavirus (COVID-19) death occurrences in care homes in October while over 8 out of 10 (82%) of Local Authorities recorded COVID-19 death registrations. This means that there were more than five times (a 428% increase) the number of Local Authorities in England and Wales recording death registrations in care homes than in September. 
</p>
<p>During October 2020 14% of all death occurrences were recorded in care homes in England and Wales. The majority (80%) were in hospitals yet care homes were the second most common place of death occurrence.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4351420"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<p>The last week in October saw the highest number of COVID-19 care home death occurrences since the end of June 2020. The same week in October saw the highest number of COVID-19 death occurrences in hospitals since mid-May 2020. COVID-19 death occurrences accounted for 6% of all deaths in care homes during October and 5% for death registrations. </p>
<h2>October increases in COVID-19 deaths per 1000 people in each local authority
</h2>
<p>During October Local authorities in the North West of England and South Wales saw the greatest number of increases in COVID-19 death registrations per 1000 of the population. 
</p>
<p>Knowsley and Liverpool had the highest proportion of COVID-19 deaths for their population size at 0.33 deaths per 1000 people. 50 people’s deaths from the virus were registered in Knowsley and 165 in Liverpool. In South Wales Rhondda Cynon Taf in South Wales had 0.32 death registrations per 1000 of the population followed by Merthyr Tydfil, which had 0.26. These figures equate to 79 and 16 deaths respectively.
</p>
<p>The last week in October 2020 saw COVID-19 death registrations increase by more than six times (533%) compared to the first week in September 2020.</p>
<p>The month of October saw 3760 deaths registered as a result of COVID-19 in England. The deaths and infections in October cumulated to form what has been described as a ‘second wave’. The sudden increase in infections and deaths following a period of decline led to the government announcing the November national restrictions. These restrictions came into place on Thursday 5 November and end on Wednesday 2 December. </p>
<p>Prior to the national lockdown English and Welsh local authorities were categorised into Tiers. Tier 1 (medium), Tier 2 (high) and Tier 3 (very high) were given depending on the level of virus outbreak in the area. </p>

<h2>How did coronavirus (COVID-19) spread across England and Wales?</h2>
<p>The first instances of COVID-19 deaths in the United Kingdom occurred in the south of England in Dover, Berkshire and Leicestershire during the week beginning 13 March 2020.</p>
<p>The week afterwards beginning 20 March the virus spread to London with a number of death registrations occurring in the capital along with deaths in a large proportion of local authorities in the West Midlands and several in the north of England and two in Wales.</p>
<p>In April the virus spread extensively to counties in the extremities of England such as Northumberland and Cornwall. </p>
<p>The following week beginning 3 April COVID-19 infections and deaths rose dramatically with 3465 death registrations across England and Wales compared to 546 the previous week. The areas with the highest numbers of deaths this week were Barnet and Birmingham with 93 and 79 death registrations respectively.</p>
<p>Deaths more than doubled during the week beginning 10 April before the worst week for death registrations in England and Wales with 8744 in the week beginning 17 April. The local authority with the highest number of deaths during this week was Birmingham with 273 death registrations. </p>
<p>May saw cases drop until June when death registrations were at a similar level to mid-March. The week with the lowest number of deaths was 4 September with 78 death registrations. Figures began to rise again after this period back to similar levels seen in May and June with 1356 death registrations in the last week of October. However, the second wave of deaths did not increase as rapidly as they did during the Spring when they tended to double in number per week compared to increasing by increments of less than double each week during the September and October months. </p>
