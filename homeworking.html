    <h1>Remote Working: The New Normal</h1>
    <h2>by Shanna Jones - 18 November 2020</h2>
    <p><b>With the workforces of many businesses being constrained to home working arrangements for the majority of 2020, businesses say that it’s not helping them better match skills to jobs but it is saving them money and staff are happier. </b></p>
    <p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has seen an exodus of workers leave offices and set up desks in their homes. With home working revealing itself as a viable option for many businesses, will the traditional office ever be the same?</p>
    <p>Across England and Wales in 2011, at the time of the last Census, 2.7 million workers said that they worked <a href="https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/qs702ew">mainly at or from home</a> making up 5.14% of the population. Midway through September 2020 the ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) asked a sample of people how the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected their lives. Of those adults who worked, 29% said that they intend to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/25september2020">continue working from home</a> all or most of the time. Among those people, 12% said they’d like to relocate, mostly to rural or coastal areas. </p>    
    <p>Prior to the pandemic in 2019 almost 30% of the workforce ever worked from home, meaning that they have done so at least once, according to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/coronavirusandhomeworkingintheuklabourmarket/2019">Coronavirus and homeworking in the UK labour market: 2019</a>.</p>
    <p>Mass shifts in the location of workers across England and Wales could have far reaching effects in many aspects of society. Past data from the ONS show where the homeworking community are and indicate future trends.</p>
    <h2>Where do people choose to work from home? (Or where do people who work from home choose to live?)</h2>
    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/4405382"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    <p>Findings from Censuses hold some of the richest data available. Although things will have likely changed considerably since the last census in 2011 due to the improvement of the reach of the internet and changing working cultures, the ONS Census data on homeworking is insightful.</p>
    <p>When looking at the percentage of homeworkers in the employed population of each local authority it becomes apparent that homeworkers tend to be common in certain rural areas. The areas with the highest percentage of homeworkers are West Somerset (26%), Ceredigion (23%), Powys (22%), Eden (22%) West Devon (21%) and Ryedale (21%). </p>
    <p>The industries of homeworkers in these beautiful countryside areas vary greatly. In West Somerset distribution, hotels and restaurants make up 33% of home workers. It is agriculture, forestry and fishing which make up the largest proportion of home workers in Eden (27%) and in Ryedale 24% of home workers are in the financial, real estate, professional and administrative activities industries.</p>
    <p>Of those home-workers who happened to live in a coastal community, the highest concentrations of people were found in the picturesque South-Western villages of Tintagel, Porlock and Lynton. It’s possible that in the next few years we may see enough internal migration from cities to picturesque rural and coastal communities to decrease the average age of their residents. In coastal communities in 2011, <a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105213527/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/coastal-communities/rpt-coastal-communities.html">20% of the population</a> were over the age of 65.</p>
    <p>Conversely, areas which had low proportions of home workers to the total number of employed people such as Kingston on Hull (5%), Knowsley (6%), Blaenau Gwent (6%), South Tyneside (6%), Corby (6%), Sandwell (6%) and Middlesbrough (6%) tended to be areas traditionally known for being both industrial and relatively deprived. </p>
    <p>In the areas with lower levels of home working, those who did work from home were likely to work in hospitality industries (distribution, hotels and restaurants) and industries with a likelihood of salaried wages and higher than average pay such as financial , real estate, professional and administrative activities industries.</p>
    <h2>Where did people work in England and Wales during 2019?</h2>
    <p>In 2019 there was a noticeable north/south divide in England with regards to home working. The South East had the highest number of employed people who were working from their home while the South West had the highest number of people who worked from the same grounds or buildings as their home or used their home as a base.</p>
    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4411680"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    <p>In recent years, the media image of the home worker has commonly depicted those doing desk jobs outside of a traditional office space the term home worker can apply to many kinds of businesses and organisations. Hospitality providers, farmers, product manufacturers, therapists and many more can feasibly work from their homes or the buildings and grounds surrounding it.  </p>
    <h2>Homeworking during lockdown</h2>
    <p>Almost half of the population (46.6%) in England and Wales did some work from home during April 2020 according to the Labour Market Survey (LMS). The region with the highest proportion of people who did some work from home was London, jointly followed by the South East and the North West at 49.4%. The area which saw the lowest proportion of people who worked from home was the West Midlands at 35.3%.</p>

    <p>Businesses that have not permanently stopped trading and more staff have been working from home were asked whether homeworking had increased the productivity of their workforce during Wave 16 of the Business Impacts of COVID-19 Survey (BICS) between the 5 October to 18 October 2020.</p>
    <p>In October The Business Impacts of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Survey (BICS) by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) asked a sample of businesses whether they felt that productivity had increased, decreased or stayed the same while their workers carried out their duties from home. The Survey found that <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/datasets/businessimpactofcovid19surveybicsresults">46% of businesses</a> in the Information and Communication industries felt their productivity had increased under these circumstances.</p>
    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4426845"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    <p>Conversely, in the mining and quarrying industries 69.2% of businesses reported a fall in productivity during lockdown’s increase in home working. When asked the reason for not wanting to continue using home working as a business model, 97.6% of businesses in the mining and quarrying industries said that it was not suitable for their business.</p>
    <h2>Has the Pandemic Inspired a Homework Revolution?</h2>
    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4426869"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    <p>When asked about the reasons for wanting to use home working as a permanent business model going forward, the most popular reason among industries overall was because of reduced overheads with the second most popular reason, business owners say, is improved staff wellbeing. </p>
    <p>Among real estate activities businesses 98.4% of respondents said that they would continue using home working as they say it improved staff wellbeing. Conversely, in the mining and quarrying businesses surveyed none of them stated that improved staff wellbeing was a reason for wanting to continue home working as a business model. Among mining and quarrying businesses, respondents wanted to continue using homeworking in order to reduce overheads or for reasons they were not sure about.</p>
    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4427199"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    <p>Regarding human health and social activities businesses 75.4% of respondents said that they wanted to use home working as they noticed that it increased productivity. 40.7% of businesses in the information and communication industries said they would use the home working model in order to recruit from a wider geographical pool.</p>
    <p>Within all industries the least common reason given for wanting to take home working forward as a permanent business model (except for the answer ‘not sure’) was the ability to better match jobs to skills.</p>
    <p>Among those businesses who did not intend to use home working as a permanent model in the future, the most common reason was that it was not suitable for their business. Following this, the second most common reason was that it reduced communication.</p>
