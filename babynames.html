    <h2>6 Baby Name Trends that Shape Modern English and Welsh Naming Culture</h2>
    <h3>by Shanna Jones - 27 November 2020</h3>
    <p>For the last seven years Oliver has been the top boys’ name while Olivia has been number one girls’ name for the fourth year. </p>
    <p>Throughout much of the 90s and 00s Jack dominated the top spot for boys’ names. In the early 1900s it was Margaret that reigned as the most popular girls’ name for three decades1. Baby names indicate trends in culture as well as being a way of identifying us as individuals. What patterns can we see in name trends and can they tell us anything about the society we live in?</p>
    <h2>A Third of Baby Girls’ Names Popular in 1904 are in Fashion Once Again</h2>
    <p>At the turn of the 20th century Florence, Edith and Ivy were some of the names high in popularity2 for baby girls. </p>
    <p>Along with many other top 100 girls’ names in 1904, they soon dropped down in the ranks. By the 60’s only 19 girls’ names that had been popular in 1904 were still in the top 100. With few matches for another 50 years, possibly due to new parents associating certain names with their parents’ or grandparents’ generations, it seemed some names had fallen out of fashion. </p>

    <p>Just longer than 100 years on from 1904, when official baby name records in England and Wales began, some vintage girls’ names from 1904 became popular once again. <b>Source: Office for National Statistics

    <p>Since 2007 the girls’ names that were popular in 1904 have been increasing in number again. 
        In 2019 one in three (33%) of girls’ names in the top 100 in 1904 were popular again. No longer constrained to the category of ‘old lady names’, Mabel, Martha, Beatrice, Edith and other ‘old fashioned’ names are fashionable once again.

    <p>Although boys’ names in the top 100 in 1904 tended to stay more popular throughout the middle of the century, at around 1 in 4 boys’ names, there has not been a recent uptake in popularity as there has been with girls’ names.</p>
    <p>There has always been a smaller pool of boys’ names than girls’ names. The slower uptake in boys’ names from 1904 compared to girls’ suggests that although a number of traditional boys’ names have stayed popular throughout the last 116 years there hasn’t been the same level of recent interest in ‘vintage’ boys’ names.</p>

    <h2>Would You Call Your Baby Keith?</h2>
    <p>Some of the most popular boys’ names from the middle of the 20th Century have dropped so far out of the rankings they are no longer even in the top 1000. Huge numbers of middle aged men are called Keith, Alan, Ian or Richard; not huge numbers of anyone under the age of 20. </p>

    <p>Graham saw the biggest fall in ranking from 19th in popularity in 1954 and 2488th in 2019. The reason for these dramatic decreases could be that parents associate these names with their parents’ or grandparents’ generations.</p>
    <h2>Names that have Stood the Test of Time</h2>
    <p> Throughout the 20th and 21st Century so far there have been 11 boys’ names that have been consistently in the top 100 baby names on every record since 1904 but just one girls’ name. Boys’ names such as Oliver, George, Arthur, Harry, Jack, Henry, Jesse and Ralph were popular when records began in 1904 and they were still in the top 100 names in 2019’s records.</p>
    <p>Baby names that have been consistently popular throughout the 20th and 21st century so far have largely been made up of names with a royal connection such as William, George, Charles, James, and the only girls’ name to be in the top 100 every year on record, Elizabeth. Sarah was also featured every decade on record but dropped out of the top 100 in 2017 and has not returned.</p>
    <h2>How Large is Our Pool of Baby Names?</h2>
    <p>In the 16 years between 1996 and 2012 the pool of baby names in England and Wales grew by 60.5%5.</p>
    <p>Between 2012 to 2019 the pool decreased by 4.4%. When compared in a chart the fluctuation of the baby name pool appears to mirror the population. Despite that it is risky to suggest that changes in population are the driving factor causing the baby name pool to grow or shrink as there are many other factors at play which influence the name pool.</p>
    <p>During the 2010’s the internet became a household resource where expectant parents could trawl through a far greater pool of baby names than would be available in a baby name book. Other factors may have influenced the fluctuation of the pool of baby names such as migration.</p>
    <p>The pool of girls’ names has been larger than the pool of boys’ names since records began in 1996. Despite this the increase in the pool of names between 1996 and the pool’s peak in 2016 has been around 2500 for both sexes. In 2016 there were 6247 boys’ names and 7514 girls’ names being used not including those removed for data protection purposes2.</p>
